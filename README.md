## Techs under the hood 
This is a small fullstack JavaScript application I made to practice. It uses **Reac** in the front and connects through **Apollo** to a simple Express **GraphQl** middleware to request field specific data from NASA's and SpaceX rest APIs. 

## What I practice 
- Apollo Client
- GraphQl Models
- GraphQl Queries
- React
